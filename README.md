A freecodecamp project for the information security certificate. A secure real time multiplayer arcade-style game using NodeJS, ExpressJS serveR and Socket.IO. The frontend makes use of HTML5 Canvas API. Chai and Mocha was used for functional tests. I have added security features using helmet.

- Open `localhost:<port_num>` on browser to see frontend
